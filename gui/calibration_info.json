  "remarks": "- The above results were those obtained at the time of calibration and refer only to the testing machine calibrated in compression. - No adjustment was performed on the testing machine. The user should determine suitability of the testing machine for its intended use. - The testing machine was calibrated at the Quality Assurance Laboratory of SYCWINCOATING & WIRES, INC. at 93 Joy St., Grace Village, Balingasa, Quezon City.",
  "uncertainty_of_measurement": "The uncertainty stated is the expanded uncertainty obtained by multiplying the standard uncertainty by the coverage factor k = 2. It has been determined in accordance with the “JCGM 100:2008 Evaluation of measurement data- Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in measurement ”. The value of the measurand lies within the assigned range of values with a probability of approximately 95%."
