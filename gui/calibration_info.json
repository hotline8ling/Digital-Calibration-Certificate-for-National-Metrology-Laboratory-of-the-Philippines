  "calibration_procedure": "The axle weighing scale was subjected to specified force values in comparison with force standard values. Three (3) series of increasing force values were applied to the axle weighing scale. The relevant references for this axle weighing scale calibration are the TP-S3-FORC-02: \"Calibration of Axle Weighing Scales\".",
  "remarks": "- The above results were those obtained at the time of calibration and refer only to the force measuring instrument (axle weighing scale) calibrated in static compression mode. - No adjustment was performed on the axle weighingscale. The user should determine suitabilityof the axle weighing scale for its intended use.",
  "uncertainty_of_measurement": "The uncertainty stated is the expanded uncertainty obtained by multiplying the standard uncertainty by the coverage factor k = 2. It has been determined in accordance with the “JCGM 100:2008 Evaluation of measurement data- Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement”. The value of the measurand lies within the assigned range of values with a probability of approximately 95%."
