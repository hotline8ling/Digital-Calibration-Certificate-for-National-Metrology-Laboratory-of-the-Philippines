Three (3) series of increasing force values were applied to the axle weighing scale ‘The relevant references for this axle weighing scale calibration are the TP-S3-FORC-02: \"Calibration of Axle Weighing Scales\"",
  "remarks": "- The above results were those obtained at the time of calibration and refer only to the force measuring instrument (axle weighing scale) calibrated in static compression mode. - No adjustment was performed on the axle weighing scale. The user should determine suitability of the axle weighing scale for its intended use.",
  "uncertainty_of_measurement": "The uncertainty stated is the expanded uncertainty obtained by multiplying the standard uncertainty by the coverage factor = 2. It has been determined in accordance with the “JCGM 100:2008 Evaluation of measurement data- Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement”. The value of the measurand lies within the assigned range of values with a probability of approximately 95%.
