  "calibration_procedure": "The testing machine under calibration was subjected to specified force values which were applied on the standard force-proving instrument and readings were noted. The relevant reference document for this calibration is ISO 7500-1:2018, Metallic materials – Verification of static uniaxial testing machines. Relative measurement error refers to the measured quantity value (indicated force) minus a reference quantity value (applied force). Relative repeatability error is a measurement precision under a set of repeatability conditions of measurement.",
  "remarks": "- The above results were those obtained at the time of calibration and refer only to the testing machine calibrated in tension. - No adjustment was performed on the testing machine. The user should determine suitabilityof the testing machine for its intended use. - The testing machine was calibrated at the Quality Control Room of AC Harris Cable Corporation at No. 5 Pio Del Pilar Cor., Magat Salamat St., Concepcion, Marikina City.",
  "uncertainty_of_measurement": "The uncertainty stated is the expanded uncertainty obtained by multiplying the standard uncertainty by the coverage factor k = 2. It has been determined in accordance with the “JCGM 100:2008 Evaluation of measurement data- Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in measurement”. The value of the measurand lies within the assigned range of values with a probability of approximately 95%."
